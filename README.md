## Course Description
R is one of the most popular statistical languages for both academic researchers and data analysts working in industry. The reason why is simple - R is free, easy to use and incredibly powerful. With R you can generate and manipulate data, conduct analyses, create plots and even write documents. The goal of this course is to introduce you to R so you can apply it to your current and future research. In this course, you will learn how to use R to conduct all steps of your data analysis, from loading data to performing analyses, to producing figures.

This course is for *anyone who wants to learn R*. I don't care if you're 10 or 100 or what your background is in programming, math, etc.. If you want to learn R and know how to use a computer, this course is for you. That said, the course is designed around the needs of a psychology student in a Bachelor's, Masters, or PhD program who has taken at least an introductory course in statistics.

This is not a traditional course -- this is a **'flipped'** course. This means that you will be learning the basic material on your own time outside of class, by actively reading and searching online resources, and then 'learn-by-doing' in class. For more information about the 'flipping' concept, check out [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom)


## Learning Materials
To learn the basic material, you will read chapters from the e-book *YaRrr! The Pirate's Guide to R* written by Dr. Nathaniel Phillips. A link to the book can be found above, and the schedule will be updated with the relevant chapters weekly.

If you are interested in additional, non-piratey materials, there are numerous books and websites that can help you discover new ways of utilizing R. Three recommended books are:

1. [Data Science with R, by Grolemund and Wickham](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). A free, online e-book on data science with R.
2. [The R Book, by Crawly](http://goo.gl/sYB5rs) by Crawly.
3. [Discovering Statistics Using R, by Field and Miles](http://goo.gl/WNKxjb) by Field and Miles

You can also find free R courses at [www.coursera.com](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming), [www.datacamp.com](www.datacamp.com), and other similar websites. As is the case with most problems, a quick Google search will likely provide good solutions.


## Weekly Programming Assignments (WPAs)
During each class, you will work on a series of programming tasks called a **Weekly Programming Assignment (WPA)**. You can do this alone, but I encourage you to discuss and/or work with the people around you. It is however very important that each student's work is his/her own. Do not turn in any assignments that you did not contribute to or do not fully understand.

The questions on WPAs will start easy to help remind you of the reading, but end hard in order to push your knowledge of the material. 

By the end of the week, you should email your WPA to me to receive credit. While I will keep track of how often you submit your WPAs, I will *not* grade them. You should however try to reply to each of the questions in the assignment in order to get a pass.


## Quiz
In week 8 there will be a quiz. This serves three purposes: 1) It will help me track how well you are doing in the course and whether you need help; 2) It will help you check how well you are grasping the materials; and 3) It will be used as part of your assessment. 

#### Time/Place
The quiz will take place during class on the **16th of April (14:15)**. You will have 1 hour to complete the quiz. If you can not attend class this week you should have contacted me to discuss alternatives.


## Final Project
At the end of the course you will complete a final analysis project. In this project, you will produce a report containing several key analyses from a dataset of your choosing. If you have a specific dataset you would like to analyze (such as from your thesis, or one available from a paper you are interested), you are welcome to use it. However, you will be provided with a list of tasks to complete/questions to answer which you must be able to complete using your dataset. Most Experimental datasets should be appropriate. If you do not have an appropriate dataset, I will assign one to you. I will give you more details about the project later in the course.


## Grading
This is a pass / fail course. Passing the course is not difficult. If you work hard, ask lots of questions, turn in your WPAs, pass the quiz and complete the final analysis project, you'll pass the class. You can miss up to 2 classes throughout the whole course.


## Tips
Learning R will be challenging, but ultimately rewarding. However, it will be a lot easier if you ask questions. Here are the best ways to ask.

**Use the help function**
If you are unsure how a function works or what its doing, type ?functionname into the console (functionname should be the name of the function e.g. ?mean). Every function has documentation, and this command will bring it up. If you don't know the exact function name, you can also type ??thingIamlooking (.e.g. ??mean) to perform a search for related documentation.

**Google Everything**
If you have a problem (particularly outside class) Google it. Almost every question you have, someone else has asked at some point. This applies particularly to R. There are a lot of good forums you might end up on, like [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/r/), or [stats.stackexchange.com](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/r), where people provide detailed answers. You also might find documentation and functions you couldn't find using the internal help, or materials from other courses. I Google R and stats related questions daily and am constantly finding innovative answers and new functions. Just keep in mind that there is no point copying someone else's code if you don't understand how it works and how to adapt it to your circumstances.

**Work together**
If you are stuck, ask people around you for help, or if you see someone struggling, help them out. Ideally I want everyone constantly talking and working together in class. Learning any type of programming is a lot easier when you have people to talk to and share ideas and problems with. 

**Ask me questions**
Thats why I'm here. If you don't know what you are doing, why something doesn't work (or does work), or what the person next to you is talking about, call me over. If you do know what you are doing, and why it works, but want to make it work better, also call me over.
