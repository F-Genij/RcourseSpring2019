Last week, for instance, we loaded data directly from a url. This week we'll load data that is saved on our machine. To do this we need to set a working directory. This is the default folder R will look in to save or load data. If we wish to load (or save) data from a different folder, we can either changed the working directory, or specify the filepath from the current working directory to the desired folder.\n",

    "In a provocative paper, Bargh, Chen and Burrows (1996) sought to test whether or not priming people with trait concepts would trigger trait-consistent behavior. In one study, they primed participants with either neutral words (e.g.; bat, cookie, pen), or with words related to an elderly stereotype (e.g.; wise, stubborn, old). They then, unbeknownst to the participants, used a stopwatch to record how long it took the participants to walk down a hallway at the conclusion of an experiment. They predicted that participants primed with words related to the elderly would walk slower than those primed with neutral words. \n",
