    "In this WPA, you will analyze data from another fake study. In this fake study the researchers were interested in whether playing video games had cognitive benefits compared to other leisure activities. In the study, 90 University students were asked to do one of 3 leisure activities for 1 hour a day for the next month. 30 participants were asked to play visio games, 30 to read and 30 to juggle. At the end of the month each participant did 3 cognitive tests, a problem solving test (**logic**) and a reflex/response test (**reflex**) and a written comprehension test (**comprehension**)."

    "In this section you are going to start with a basic task you want to perform. In this case we want to create a copy of our dataset where all the test variables (`logic`, `reflex` and `comprehension`) have all been normalized. We will us this task firstly to demonstrate the benefit of using loops, then the benefit of using custom functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Firstly create a copy of the data.frame `leisure`. Call this copy `zleisure.manual`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Using indexing of the column name, normalise the `logic` column in your new dataset. Do not create a new column, just overwrite the `logic` column with the normalised zcores. Remember that to normalse a score, also called z-transforming it, you first subtract the mean score from the individual scores, then divide by the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use the same method to normalise the other test columns; `reflex`, and `comprehension`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create another copy of the `leisure` data.frame called `zleisure.loop`. We will perform the same normalisation on this data.frame using a simple loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. First create a loop that loops through each of the test column names  (i.e. `logic`, `reflex` and `comprehension`). This will require a vector of the test column. For now have the loop print each column name as it goes through (using `print`). The output should look as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Now modify the loop from Question D5 so that each time it loops through it takes the named column and replaces the values in this column with the normalised scores. You already have a loop to go through the column names, and code that takes a column based on its name and repalces the values in that column with the normalzied values (see Qu D2/D3). All you need to do is combine them.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Check that the `logic` column you normalised manually is the same as the `logic` column normalized by the loop using `==`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What if we decided that we also want to normalise the particpants ages. How easy is this to do in our loop?\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Now we have a loop that takes the data.frame `zleisure.loop` and for the 4 columns `age`, `logic`, `reflex` and `comprehension` it replaces the raw scores in that column with the z-transformed/normalized scores. This code seems pretty good, it only take 2 lines, and is much easier than typing out the code to normalize each column manually. It can also e easily expanded to include new columns. However, what if we wanted to perform the same operation on another dataset? Load the fictional survey data from **WPA6**. Call it `wpa6.df`.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. This data.frame also has several test scores we might want to normalize, in particular the `iq`, `logic` and `multitasking` scores. Write a loop to normalise these scores (use your zleisure loop as a start point). Call the data.frame with the normalised scores `zwpa6.df`.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. There should be only 3 differences between the code in question D6, and the code in question D10. The only changes are the names of the data.frames (`wpa6.df` verse `leisure`; and `zwpa6.df` verse `zleisure.loop`) and the names of the columns. The actual operations being performed are identical, and the structure of the code is identical. When this happens its usually a pretty good sign that you should write a custom functon to perform this operation, rather than modifying your code each time. So now we are going to create a function, which we'll call `zbycolumn`, which takes any data.frame and from that creates a new data.frame where the values in a subset of the columns are z.transformed. Since we want to be able to specify the data.frame and the columns that are to be z.transformed this function will need to accept two arguments, the data.frame (which we will call `data`) and the columns that are to be z.transformed (which we will call `colunnames`). Create an empty function that accepts these two arguments. Now that you have a function that accepts the appropriate arguments, modify your code from exercise D10 so that it uses these arguments names rather than the `wpa6.df` and `iq`, `logic` etc.. Call the z.transformed version of the `data`, `z.data`. Now place this code inside the empty function you created. remember to add a `return` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Test your function by performing the normalisation on the `leisure` data.frame again. Call the output of the function `zleisure.function` and compare it to the manual or loop versions of the dataframe."
