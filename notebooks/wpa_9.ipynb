    "In this WPA, you will analyze data from a study on student performance in two classes: math and Portugese. These data come from the UCI Machine Learning database at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance#\n",

    "\n",
    "Here is the data description (taken directly from the original website):\n",
    "\n",
    "*This data approach student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features) and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). In [Cortez and Silva, 2008], the two datasets were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Important note: the target attribute G3 has a strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. This occurs because G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd period grades. It is more difficult to predict G3 without G2 and G1, but such prediction is much more useful (see paper source for more details).*"

    "1. Open a new script and enter your name, date, and the wpa number at the top. Set the working directory to the appropriate location using `setwd` (or add the script to your R Project). Save the script in the `R` folder in your project working directory as `wpa_9_LASTFIRST.R`, where LAST and FIRST are your last and first names. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Download the data from the website (by clicking on `Data Folder`, and unzipping the downloaded `student` folder on your computer). We are going to use two of the files contained in the `student` folder: `student-mat.csv` and `student-por.csv`. Move them in the `data` folder you created (**in WPA 3**) in the `R project` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Set the working directory to the `data` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Load `student-mat.csv` and `student-por.csv` using `read.table()` as new objects, called, respectively, `student.math` and `student.por`. To load them, you shouldn't use the whole path, but just the file name. This, of course, only if you did points 2 and 3 correctly. Look back at **WPA 3** if you are having difficulties. You should not use `file.choose` to lead the data. You can help yourself using tab completion (https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200404846-Working-in-the-Console#completion).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Look at the first few rows of the dataframe with the `head()` function to make sure it loaded correctly. If you see something weird (e.g., all the values are stuck together in one column) try to change the `sep` argument: With which character do you think the values were separated with?\n",
