    "In this WPA, you will analyze data from a (again...fake) study on attraction. In the study, 1000 heterosexual University students viewed the Facebook profile of another student (the \"target\") of the opposite sex. Based on a target's profile, each participant made three judgments about the target - intelligence, attractiveness, and dateability. The primary judgement was a *dateability* rating indicating how dateable the person was on a scale of 0 to 100."
